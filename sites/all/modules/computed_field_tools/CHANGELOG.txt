Computed field tools 7.x-1.1
============================
- Support for entity types in general. Most entity types should work now, if
  they follow the structure of the node or the user f.ex. But it's still trial
  and error, if it works or not.
- Now warming up the static cache for entity loads, which should speed up the
  processing of the computed fields considerably. Best time recorded halfed the
  total processing time. It should also help with the memory leak issue when
  using drush to compute the fields.
- Reversed the order of the processing so that the latest content is fixed
  first.
- When running through drush, the memory peak is outputted. Helps spotting
  memory leaks before they become a critical issue.
- Fixed a lot of Coder and code sniffer issues.
- Now using merge rather that the update/insert logic. This should eliminate the
  myriad of warnings related to that.
- Fixed a bug, that did'nt allow to recompute across multiple entity types, when
  the entity count exceeded the batch run count.

Computed field tools 7.x-1.0
